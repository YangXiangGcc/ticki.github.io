      <title>A Critique of Rust&#39;s `std::collections`</title>

      <description>Rust is by far my favorite language, and I am very familiar with it, but there is one aspect that annoys me at times: std::collections, a part of the opt-out standard library.
This post will go through the short-fallings of the API and implementation of std::collections. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to present alternatives and way to improve it.
Update: The title was previously &amp;ldquo;Why std::collections is absolutely horrible&amp;rdquo;. It was in the hope to spark critical discussion, however people were rather annoyed by this title (and I understand why), so I changed it to something less provocative.</description>
