      <title>On the Google Manifesto Controversy</title>

      <description>The infamous manifesto from the (now former) Google employee has made its round on the internet. It alleges an ideological ecochamber and overly commitment to diversity on the work place, as well as reverse discrimination and the alike. He claims that the inequalities are not necessarily due to discrimination but presumably biological differences.
When he says things like that - especially when he spreads these ideas, he actively supports a culture already existing, where women are vastly underrepresented - without making a proper case of why.</description>

      <description>When you discuss socialism, you are guaranteed to hear someone say &amp;quot;socialism won&#39;t work because of human nature&amp;quot;. This argument is particularly lazy, but I keep hearing it, so I wanted to address it in my own words.
What the argument entails It is incredibly vague, but it usually goes something like
 Greed and selfishness is an essential part of human nature, hence socialism will fail.
 It often follows that capitalism is the only system that works.</description>

      <description>It was a surprising and intense outcome to watch yesterday night. As you probably know by now, Trump won, contrary to all predictions and calls.
But why?
I&amp;rsquo;m not an US citzen, but I have followed the race with great passion, and I want to give my outsider two-cents on &amp;lsquo;what the hell is going&amp;rsquo; in United States of America.
So, what did we actually learn?
1. USA is a post-fact society Many of the things Trump have said are lies, and it is often trivial to prove so.</description>
